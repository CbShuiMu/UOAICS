## Technical Implementation

### Course Information Extraction

The extension extracts course information through the following methods:

1. **Primary Selector**: `td.uoa_gridborder_cal.uoa_cal_ENRL_stat`
2. **Backup Selectors**: Multiple backup selectors ensure compatibility
3. **Data Parsing**: Parse course time, code, room, and building information

### ICS File Generation

The generated ICS file contains:
- Standard iCalendar format
- Course time information
- Room and building location
- Unique event ID

### Supported Course Format

The extension can parse course information in the following format:
```
12:00PM - 3:00PM
GLMI 709
260-223
OGGB
```

## Permission Requirements

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: Access current tab
- `scripting`: Execute scripts in target page
- `downloads`: Download generated ICS files
- `host_permissions`: Access University of Auckland website

## Development Guide

### Local Development

1. Clone the project to local
2. Load the extension in Chrome extension management page
3. Click "Reload" button after modifying code

### Debugging

- Open Chrome Developer Tools
- View Console tab for debug information
- Use Chrome extension's "Inspect popup" feature to debug popup

## Important Notes

1. **Icon Files**: Currently using placeholder files, need to replace with real PNG icons for actual use
2. **Course Time**: The extension assumes courses are in the current semester, may need adjustment based on actual semester
3. **Website Compatibility**: If the University of Auckland website structure changes, selectors may need to be updated
